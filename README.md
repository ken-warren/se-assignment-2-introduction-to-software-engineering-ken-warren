## Questions and Answers

**Define Software Engineering:**
What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?

- Software Engineering is the process of designing, developing, testing and maintaining software applications [Sommerville, I, 2015](#references).
- Software Engineering differs from traditional programming in that it involves a systematic and structured approach e.g in project management and documentation while the latter only  focuses on writing and debugging codes


**Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):**

- This is a structured process used by software developers to design, develop, test and deploy software application [Pressman, R. S., & Maxim, B. R., 2014](#references).


Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
The 7 phases of SDLC are:
1. Project Planning: Defining the scope, objectives, and feasibility of the project.
2. Gathering requirements and analysis: Gathering and documenting what the users and stakeholders need from the software.
3. Design: Gathering and documenting what the users and stakeholders need from the software.
4. Implementing(Coding): Writing the actual code for the software.
5. Testing: Verification that the software id working correctly and free of bugs
6. Deployment: Making the software publicly available to users
7. Maintenance: Updating and improving the software over time to fix issues, add features, and adapt to new requirements.


**Agile vs. Waterfall Models:**

- Agile is a flexible approach to software development that emphasizes on collaboration, customer feedback, and frequent releases, while the Waterfall model is a linear approach where each phase must be completed before the next, emphasizing upfront planning and documentation [Pressman, R. S., & Maxim, B. R., 2014](#references)..

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?

| Aspect                | Agile Model                                         | Waterfall Model                                  |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Approach**          | Iterative and incremental                           | Sequential and linear                            |
| **Flexibility**       | Highly flexible; changes can be made at any stage   | Low flexibility; changes are difficult to implement once the project is underway |
| **Project Phases**    | Divided into small iterations (sprints)             | Divided into distinct phases                     |
| **Customer Involvement** | Continuous feedback and involvement throughout the process | Limited to specific milestones (e.g., requirements, testing) |
| **Delivery**          | Frequent, small releases of functional software     | Single delivery after the final phase            |
| **Documentation**     | Less emphasis on documentation; focuses on working software | Extensive documentation required for each phase  |
| **Testing**           | Continuous testing throughout the development cycle | Testing phase comes after the implementation phase |
| **Team Collaboration**| High level of collaboration and communication       | Less collaboration; each phase handled by different teams |
| **Risk Management**   | Easier to manage risks due to iterative nature      | Risk management can be challenging as risks are identified late |
| **Suitability**       | Best for projects with uncertain or evolving requirements | Best for projects with well-defined and stable requirements |


**Requirements Engineering:**
What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.

Requirements engineering is the process of defining, documenting, and maintaining the requirements for a software system to ensure it meets the needs of users and stakeholders.The process involves gathering, analyzing, documenting, validating and managing the users' needs. It's important because it ensures that the final product aligns with user expectations and business goals, thereby reducing the risk of project failure, minimizing costly rework, and providing a clear foundation for design, development, and testing activities [Sommerville, I, 2015](#references).

**Software Design Principles:**
Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?

- Modularity in software design refers to the practice of dividing a software system into distinct, independent units or modules, each responsible for a specific piece of functionality. These modules can be developed, tested, and maintained separately but work together to form a complete system.

- Modularity in software design involves dividing a system into self-contained modules, improving maintainability by isolating changes and simplifying testing, and enhancing scalability by enabling parallel development and reusability. For example, Apache Hadoop uses modular components like HDFS for storage and MapReduce for data processing, allowing independent updates and efficient handling of large data sets. This modular approach ensures that changes in one part of the system do not disrupt the whole, and enables teams to work simultaneously on different modules [Chacon, S., & Straub, B., 2014](#references).

**Testing in Software Engineering:**
Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing).

[Myers, G. J., Sandler, C., & Badgett, 2011](#references) elaborates on the following levels of software testing;
- Unit Testing - involves testing individual components to ensure they work correctly in isolation.
- Integration Testing - focuses on interactions between integrated units to identify interface and data flow issues.
- System Testing verifies the complete software system against specified requirements.
- Acceptance Testing ensures the software meets user needs and is ready for delivery.

Why is testing crucial in software development?

- Testing ensures reliability, performance and quality.
- It helps to identify and fix bugs early.
- It verifies that the software meets user requirements and specifications.
- Thorough testing mitigates risks associated with software failures, ensuring the software is secure, robust, and ready for deployment.

**Version Control Systems:**
What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.

- Version control systems (VCS) are tools that help manage changes to source code over time, enabling multiple developers to work collaboratively on a project by tracking and merging changes, maintaining a history of revisions, and facilitating rollback to previous states if needed [Chacon, S., & Straub, B., 2014](#references).

The importance of VCS includes:
1. Collaboration: Multiple developers can work simultaneously without overwriting changes.
2. History and Tracking: Maintains a history of changes to track modifications and identify contributors.
3. Backup and Recovery: Regular backups and the ability to revert to previous versions.
4. Branching and Merging: Facilitates parallel development and integration.

Examples include:
- Git - Features are distributed version control, branching and merging, community support, extensive documentation and integration with GitHub, GitLab and Bitbucket.**
- Subversion (SVN) - Features include centralized version control, atomic commits, versioned directories, efficient handling of binary files and extensive plug-in support**


**Software Project Management:**
Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?

- A software project manager is responsible for planning, executing, and closing software projects, ensuring they are completed on time, within budget, and to the required quality standards.

Key responsibilities are;
1. Planning - Develop a good project plan, including timelines, milestones and resources allocation.
2. Team Management - Assembling, leading and assigning tasks and responsibilities to the project team
3. Budget Management - Creating the budget and managing it by ensuring expenses are within the allocated funds.
4.  Risk Management - Assessing the potential risks and developing mitigation strategies.
5. Quality Assurance - Ensuring that the project meets quality standards by monitoring testing and review process

Challenges faced include:
- Uncontrolled changes or continuous growth in projects scope can lead to delays and overruns in the budget
- Limited skilled personnel, low budget and time pressure can impact delivery.
- Risk management for complex projects can be challenging.
- Integrating rapid technology changes or advancements can be demanding

**Software Maintenance:**
Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities.

- Software maintenance is the process of modifying and updating software applications after their initial deployment to correct faults, improve performance, or adapt the software to a changed environment [IEEE Standard for Software Maintenance. (1998)](#references).

Types of maintenance activities:
1. Corrective Maintenance: Fixes bugs and errors discovered after deployment.
2. Adaptive Maintenance: Adjusts software to accommodate changes in the environment, like OS upgrades.
3. Perfective Maintenance: Enhances features and adds new functionalities based on user feedback.
4. Preventive Maintenance: Makes changes to prevent future issues and improve reliability.

Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?

- It ensures software longevity, improves performance, security and increases users' satisfaction.


**Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:**
What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face?

- Privacy: Protecting user data from misuse and exposure.
- Security: Implementing measures to prevent breaches and attacks.
