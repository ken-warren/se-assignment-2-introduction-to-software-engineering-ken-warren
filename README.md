# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
- **Software Engineering is the process of designing, developing, testing and maintaining software applications**

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
- **Software Engineering differs from traditional programming in that it involves a systematic and structured approach e.g in project management and documentation while the latter only  focuses on writing and debugging codes**

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
- **This is a structured process used by software developers to design, develop, test and deploy software applications.** 

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
**The 7 phases of SDLC are:**
**1. Project Planning: Defining the scope, objectives, and feasibility of the project.**
**2. Gathering requirements and analysis: Gathering and documenting what the users and stakeholders need from the software.**
**3. Design: Gathering and documenting what the users and stakeholders need from the software.**
**4. Implementing(Coding): Writing the actual code for the software.**
**5. Testing: Verification that the software id working correctly and free of bugs**
**6. Deployment: Making the software publicly available to users**
**7. Maintenance: Updating and improving the software over time to fix issues, add features, and adapt to new requirements.**

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

**Agile is a flexible approach to software development that emphasizes on collaboration, customer feedback, and frequent releases, while the Waterfall model is a linear approach where each phase must be completed before the next, emphasizing upfront planning and documentation.**

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in 
what scenarios might each be preferred?

| Aspect                | Agile Model                                         | Waterfall Model                                  |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Approach**          | Iterative and incremental                           | Sequential and linear                            |
| **Flexibility**       | Highly flexible; changes can be made at any stage   | Low flexibility; changes are difficult to implement once the project is underway |
| **Project Phases**    | Divided into small iterations (sprints)             | Divided into distinct phases                     |
| **Customer Involvement** | Continuous feedback and involvement throughout the process | Limited to specific milestones (e.g., requirements, testing) |
| **Delivery**          | Frequent, small releases of functional software     | Single delivery after the final phase            |
| **Documentation**     | Less emphasis on documentation; focuses on working software | Extensive documentation required for each phase  |
| **Testing**           | Continuous testing throughout the development cycle | Testing phase comes after the implementation phase |
| **Team Collaboration**| High level of collaboration and communication       | Less collaboration; each phase handled by different teams |
| **Risk Management**   | Easier to manage risks due to iterative nature      | Risk management can be challenging as risks are identified late |
| **Suitability**       | Best for projects with uncertain or evolving requirements | Best for projects with well-defined and stable requirements |


Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.

**Requirement engineering is the process of defining, documenting, and maintaining the requirements for a software system to ensure it meets the needs of users and stakeholders.The process involves gathering, analyzing, documenting, validating and managing the users' needs. It's important because it ensures that the final product aligns with user expectations and business goals, thereby reducing the risk of project failure, minimizing costly rework, and providing a clear foundation for design, development, and testing activities.**

Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
